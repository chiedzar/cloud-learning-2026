My 8-week deep dive into cloud computing☁️ – tutorials, experiments, and progress!

Welcome to my **8-week cloud computing learning journey**! This repo is where I track tutorials, exercises, experiments, and notes as I build my cloud skills.

## About

This project is part of my 2026 self-study plan to learn cloud computing fundamentals, practical skills, and related technologies like software and IoT. Each week focuses on a specific topic, with hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.

## Weekly Plan

|------|------------|
| 1    | Cloud fundamentals & basic concepts |
| 2    | Cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) |
| 3    | Virtualization & containers |
| 4    | Cloud providers overview (AWS, Azure, GCP) |
| 5    | Storage & databases in the cloud |
| 6    | Networking, security, and identity |
| 7    | Monitoring, automation & DevOps basics |
| 8    | Mini project & consolidation |

> Note: This is a personal learning repo; all exercises, notes, and projects are for practice purposes.
